         <h2>Early Life</h2>
           <p>Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens
             in New York City, the fourth child of Fred Trump, a Bronx-born real estate developer
              whose parents were German immigrants, and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, an immigrant from Scotland.
               Trump grew up with older siblings Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and younger brother
                Robert in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens and attended the private Kew-Forest
                 School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York
                  Military Academy, a private boarding school, and in 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University.
                   Two years later he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,
                    graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics. The New York Times reported in 1973
                     and 1976 that he had graduated first in his class at Wharton, but he had never made the
                      school's honor roll. In 2015, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Fordham
                       University and the New York Military Academy with legal action if they released 
                       Trump's academic records. While in college, Trump obtained four student draft
                        deferments. In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon\
                         a medical examination, and in July 1968 a local draft board classified him as
                          eligible to serve. In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical
                           deferment, and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to bone spurs, permanently
                            disqualifying him from service.

            <h2>Business career</h2>
            <h3>Real estate</h3>
            <p>While a student at Wharton and after graduating in 1968, Trump worked at his father Fred's real
                estate company, Trump Management, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's 
                outer boroughs. In 1971, he became president of the company and began using The Trump
                 Organization as an umbrella brand. It was registered as a corporation in 1981.
            </p>
            <h3>Manhattan developments</h3>
            <p>Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan
                venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.
                 The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred
                  Trump, who also joined Hyatt in guaranteeing $70 million in bank construction financing.
                   The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, and that same year, Trump obtained
                    rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building 
                    houses the headquarters of the Trump Organization and was Trump's primary residence until
                     2019.

            <h3>Foundation</h3>
            <p>
             The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988. In the foundation's
              final years its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal
               funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014. The foundation gave to health care and sports-related
                charities, as well as conservative groups. In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal
                and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion. Also in 2016,
                New York State attorney general's office said the foundation appeared to be in violation of New 
                York laws regarding charities and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in
                 New York. Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.
